# Amazon Product Insights Dashboard

## Overview

This project was created as part of Task 3 for a Data Analyst Internship. The objective was to design a professional, interactive dashboard using Power BI that enables business stakeholders to understand product-level insights from an Amazon product dataset.

The dashboard provides a clear view of how different products are priced, rated, and reviewed across categories, offering actionable insights into customer satisfaction and discount effectiveness.
